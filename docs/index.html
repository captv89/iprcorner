              <h2>Copyright Law</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">..a person&rsquo;s exclusive right to reproduce, publish, or sell his or her original work of authorship..</p>
              
              <p>
 The dictionary defines copyright as “a person’s exclusive right to reproduce, publish, or sell his or her original work of authorship (as a literary, musical, dramatic, artistic, or architectural work)”.
</p> <p>
 It’s important to understand that copyright law covers the  “form of material expression”, not the actual concepts, ideas, techniques, or facts in a particular work. This is the reason behind why a work
 <br/>
 must be fixed in a tangible form in order to receive copyright protection. A couple examples of works being fixed in a tangible form include stories written on paper and original paintings on canvas
</p> <h3 id="what-is-protected-by-copyright">
 What is Protected by ‘Copyright’?
</h3> <p>
 When someone creates a product that is viewed as original and that required significant mental activity to create, this product becomes intellectual property that must be protected from unauthorized duplication. Examples of unique creations include computer software, art, poetry, graphic designs, musical lyrics and compositions, novels, film, original architectural designs, website content, etc. One safeguard that can be used to protect an original creation is copyright.
</p> <h3 id="a-copyright-owners-rights">
 A Copyright Owner’s Rights
</h3> <p>
 The primary goal of copyright law is to protect the time, effort, and creativity of the work’s creator. As such, the Copyright Act gives the copyright owner certain exclusive rights, including the right to:
 <br/>
 - Reproduce the work
 <br/>
 - Prepare “derivative works” (other works based on the original work)
 <br/>
 - Distribute copies of the work by sale, lease, or other transfer of ownership
 <br/>
 - Perform the work publicly
 <br/>
 - Display the work publicly
</p> <p>
 The copyright owner also has the right to authorize other people to do any of the rights mentioned above. The copyright owner has the option and ability to transfer his or her exclusive rights.
</p> <h3 id="importance-of-obtaining-a-copyright-protection">
 Importance of obtaining a Copyright Protection
</h3> <p>
 There are two types of rights under copyright:
 <br/>
 <strong>
  Economic rights
 </strong>
 , which allow the rights owner to derive financial reward from the use of his works by others; and
 <br/>
 <strong>
  Moral rights
 </strong>
 , which protect the non-economic interests of the author.
</p> <p>
 Most copyright laws state that the rights owner has the economic right to authorize or prevent certain uses in relation to a work or, in some cases, to receive remuneration for the use of his work (such as through collective management). The economic rights owner of a work can prohibit or authorize:
 <br/>
 1. its reproduction in various forms, such as printed publication or sound recording;
 <br/>
 2. its public performance, such as in a play or musical work;
 <br/>
 3. its recording, for example, in the form of compact discs or DVDs;
 <br/>
 4. its broadcasting, by radio, cable or satellite;
 <br/>
 5. its translation into other languages; and
 <br/>
 6. its adaptation, such as a novel into a film screenplay.
</p> <p>
 Examples of widely recognized moral rights include the right to claim authorship of a work and the right to oppose changes to a work that could harm the creator’s reputation.
</p> <h3 id="steps-involved-in-obtaining-a-copyright-protection">
 Steps involved in obtaining a Copyright Protection
</h3> <ol>
 <li>
  Ensure your work is properly marked
 </li>
 <li>
  Register your work.
 </li>
 <li>
  Keep the Supporting Evidence.
 </li>
 <li>
  Make an agreement with Co-authors/owners.
 </li>
</ol> <h3 id="registration-of-a-copyright">
 Registration of a Copyright
</h3> <p>
 In the majority of countries, and according to the Berne Convention, copyright protection is obtained automatically without the need for registration or other formalities.
</p> <p>
 Most countries nonetheless have a system in place to allow for the voluntary registration of works. Such voluntary registration systems can help solve disputes over ownership or creation, as well as facilitate financial transactions, sales, and the assignment and/or transfer of rights.
</p> <p>
 In India, the registration of copyright is not mandatory as the registration is treated as mere recordal of a fact. The registration does not create or confer any new right and is not a prerequisite for initiating action against infringement. The view has been upheld by the Indian courts in a catena of judgments. It is important to note here that there is no prescribed time limit within which registration of a copyright can be obtained. However, presently the registration of a copyright may take a period of 1 to 1 ½ years.
</p> <h3 id="durationterm-of-copyright">
 Duration/Term of Copyright
</h3> <p>
 In the case of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, the duration of copyright is the lifetime of the author or artist, and 60 years counted from the year following the death of the author.
</p> <p>
 In the case of cinematographic films, sound recordings, photographs, posthumous publications, anonymous and pseudonymous publications, works of government and works of international organizations are protected for a period of 60 years which is counted from the year following the date of publication.
</p> <h3 id="licensing-and-assignment-of-copyright">
 Licensing and Assignment of Copyright
</h3> <p>
 Copyright in any work, present or future, can only be assigned or licensed in writing by the copyright owner or his duly authorized agent.
</p> <h3 id="protection-to-foreign-works-in-india">
 Protection to Foreign Works in India
</h3> <p>
 Copyright of “works” of foreign nationals, whose countries are member of Convention Countries to which India is a signatory, are protected against any infringement of their “works” in India through the International Copyright Order, 1999. The Indian Courts have also been pro-active for the protection of Copyright of foreign authors/owners, which includes software, motion pictures including screen play of motion pictures and database.
</p> <p>
 The Government of India is also taking initiative to combat piracy in the software industry, motion pictures and the music industry along with players in the industry through their associations and organizations like NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies), NIAPC (National Initiative Against Piracy and Counterfeiting) etc.

              <h2>Patent Law</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">..Your Ideas &amp; Inventions are precious, Secure it by getting a patent..</p>
              
              <p>
 You have come up with an idea and you believe it doesn’t exist and thinking of filing a patent for the idea in India and probably other countries. You work on it further and crystallize it to a level where the idea has taken a form of a unique device, method, composition or a process (commonly known as an Invention).
</p> <p>
 A patent is a form of Intellectual Property, which protects and covers inventions. It is a limited time monopoly given by countries in exchange for the disclosure of the invention. The patent holder gets exclusive rights for a term of 20 years generally and the world gets the advantage of uncovering new technologies, which otherwise may have been kept secret and ultimately lost.
</p> <h3 id="patent-protection-for-an-invention-is-necessary">
 Patent protection for an invention is necessary
</h3> <p>
 Developing something unique and innovative is an incredible feat of creativity that can go a long way in attracting attention in your field of interest. Can your invention be patented? This will provide a range of safeguards for inventors against a competitor stealing and reproducing their creations.
</p> <p>
 A patent is a legally enforceable right that can be granted in relation to a device, substance, method or process which is new, inventive and useful. A patent is a legally enforceable instrument. A patent provides that you are the owner of the invention, with the exclusive rights to market this patent to generate income for your business.
</p> <h3 id="few-steps-involved-in-getting-a-patent">
 Few steps involved in getting a patent
</h3> <h4 id="stage-1-invention-disclosure">
 Stage 1: invention disclosure
</h4> <p>
 This is initial phase when you disclose your invention to the patent professional (patent agent) by signing a Non-disclosure agreement. Here you should submit each know fact about your invention, description diagrams and experimental results (if any). Hold nothing back.
</p> <h4 id="stage-2-novelty-search-patentability-search">
 Stage 2: Novelty search (patentability search)
</h4> <p>
 The professional charges at this phase range from (Rs 10,000 to Rs.20,000 )
</p> <p>
 In this phase, patent professional performed an extensive search for prior art in all possible databases for patent, articles, thesis etc… And builds a patentability search report based on closest prior art found for your invention.
</p> <h4 id="stage-3-decide-to-file-patent-application">
 Stage 3: Decide to file patent application
</h4> <p>
 On reviewing the patentability search report and discovered closest prior arts for your invention you can take a decision whether to go ahead with patent application filing.
</p> <p>
 Your invention needs to have “inventive step” as compared with existing prior art to be able to qualify for a patent. The inventive step is achieved when your invention has either ‘technical advance’ or ‘economic significance’ or both over existing prior arts.
</p> <p>
 When you decide to go ahead with patent filing next step is writing patent application also called as patent drafting.
</p> <h4 id="stage-4-patent-drafting-patent-writing">
 Stage 4: Patent drafting (patent writing)
</h4> <p>
 Patent drafting charges range from Rs. 20,000 to 30,000 (professional fees)
</p> <p>
 Drafting a patent application is a specialized job and requires both technical (field of invention) and legal (Indian patent act) understanding.
</p> <p>
 As you may have heard, patent is a techno-legal document. Many inventors trying to write patent application on their own writes it from completely technical perspective. Writing patent application as a technical document without considering legal aspect may be a mistake which can make your application not worth a lot. And all the efforts you took for research and development can go waste.
</p> <p>
 Hence, right patent professional (patent agent) with appropriate experience can remarkably add value to patent application.
</p> <h4 id="stage-5-filing-patent-application">
 Stage 5:  Filing Patent application
</h4> <p>
 When you done with the review of patent drafted and satisfied with the scope and technical details in the patent application, you can file the patent application is prescribed manner. That is with appropriate forms with appropriate fees. You need to pay fees of Rs. 1600 or 4000 0r 8000 (based on type of applicant) while submitting the patent application in patent office.
</p> <p>
 If you do not file request for early publication (fees mentioned in table below) the patent application will be published on expiry of 18 months.
</p> <h4 id="stage-6-request-for-examination">
 Stage 6: Request for Examination
</h4> <p>
 Request for examination fees is Rs. 4000 or 10000 or 20000 (based on type of applicant)
</p> <p>
 The request for examination is to be made within 48 months from the date of filing the patent application, along with prescribed form and fees. This is the request made to Indian patent office to examine you patent application.
</p> <h4 id="stage-7-responding-to-objections-in-examination-report">
 Stage 7: Responding to objections in examination report
</h4> <p>
 The first examination report submitted to controller by examiner generally contains prior arts (existing documents before the date of filing) which are similar to the claimed invention, and same is reported to patent applicant.
</p> <h4 id="step-8-respond-to-objections">
 Step 8: respond to objections
</h4> <p>
 Majority of patent applicants will receive some type of objections based on examination report. The best thing to do it analyze the examination report along with patent professional (patent agent) and creating a response to the objections raised in the examination report.
</p> <p>
 This is a chance for an inventor to communicate his novelty or inventive step over prior arts found in the examination report. The inventor and patent agent create and send a response to the examination that tries to prove to controller that his invention is indeed patentable and satisfies all patentability criteria’s.
</p> <h4 id="step-9-grant-of-patent">
 Step 9: Grant of patent
</h4> <p>
 The application would be placed in order for grant once it is found to be meeting all patentability requirements. The grant of patent is notified in the patent journal which is published time to time.
</p> <h4 id="stage-10-renewal-of-patent">
 Stage 10: Renewal of Patent
</h4> <p>
 Maintaining patent for its entire life time that is 20 years from filing date requires renewal fees which shall be decided by a patent attorney.

              <h2>Trademark Law</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">A great trademark is appropriate, dynamic, distinctive, memorable and unique. - Primo Angeli</p>
              
              <p><p>
 Trade mark is a branch of Intellectual Property Right. A trademark includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods. This also includes shape of the goods, colour combinations and now even particular sounds. A trademark grants the holder protection for a period of 10 years from its registration and can be renewed as long as the brand continues. A service mark is similar to a trademark except it helps in distinguishing between the services offered by different individuals or entities.
</p> <p>
 In short, a trademark is a brand name. Trademark is a mark or symbol which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one from those of others.
</p> <h3 id="owner-of-trademark">
 Owner of Trademark:
</h3> <p>
 It is not mandatory to register your mark, however, it is highly advisable to do so. There are numerous benefits associated with registering a trademark starting from exclusivity of using a specific mark to receiving a registration certificate from the government recognizing ownership of the brand. Trademark provides protection to the owner of the mark by ensuring the exclusive rights to use in to identify the goods or services or authorize another to use it in return of payment. It works like a weapon in the hand of registered proprietor or owner of the mark to stop other traders from unlawful use of the mark of the registered owner.
</p> <p>
 A trade mark shall give to the registered proprietor of the trademark, the exclusive right to the use of the mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of the trademark in the manner provided under the Act. The proprietor of a trade mark has a right to file a suit for infringement of his right and obtain:
 <br/>
 1. Injunction,
 <br/>
 2. Damages,
 <br/>
 3. Account of profits
</p> <h3 id="why-register-a-trademark">
 Why register a Trademark :
</h3> <p>
 There are numerous benefits associated with registering a trademark starting from exclusivity of using a specific mark to receiving a registration certificate from the government recognizing ownership of the brand. A very appealing factor of registering a trademark is the protection provided to the goodwill associated with the registered mark. Registration also ensures that your mark is not copied or reproduced by anyone and even should your mark be used without your authorisation, the Indian Trademark Act provides ample recourse and remedies.
</p> <h3 id="steps-involved-in-registering-a-trademark">
 Steps involved in registering a Trademark :
</h3> <p>
 <strong>
  1. Identify the Mark / Logo to be registered as Trade Mark
 </strong>
 <br/>
 While choosing a name it is important to choose something unique. This may seem difficult with all the names already taken, however the following name choosing strategies may help in selecting the right brand name-
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  Invented Words
 </strong>
 - New words may be created by combining two or more words. These words generally do not have any dictionary meanings and are usually unique.
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  Arbitrary adoption
 </strong>
 - A word that has a specific dictionary meaning but is used for an altogether different product or service. For example Apple for computers.
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  Acronyms
 </strong>
 - Acronyms having unique full forms.
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  2. Search the availably of Trade Name / Mark for registration
 </strong>
 <br/>
 Once you have thought of a suitable name, the next step is to check whether it is available or is already in use. The easiest way to check is to do a search on the Indian Trademark Registry database. This may be done by any Trademark Agent or Attorney. However, it is best if the search is not restricted only to the Indian Trademark Registry database, rather a comprehensive search should also be conducted on the MCA database as well as on common law databases.
</p> <p>
 It is advisable to seek the assistance of a licensed trademark Attorney in filing for a trademark. The trademark search is a very important facet of the registration process. A trademark search is essential since it shows whether any identical or similar marks to your proposed mark are already in use or have been applied for. The search option acts as a safeguard so that you do not unwittingly infringe upon the trademark of any third party.
</p> <p>
 The trademark search can be carried out in two ways. It can either be done solely on the Indian trademark registry database, which we call a basic search, or it may be done on the Indian trademark registry database, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database, the Madrid Protocol records and common law databases.
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  3. Identifying the Class under which the TradeMark has to be registered
 </strong>
 <br/>
 The search in the Indian trademark registry database is conducted class wise. Hence, the applicant’s goods and services have to be segregated as per their classes. There are 45 classes falling under trademarks of which classes 1 to 34 deal with goods and 35 to 45 deal in services.  A mark may either be filed in a single class or applicants may elect for multi class filing. The charges (both government and professional fee) are based on per class chosen for filing.
</p> <p>
 <strong>
  4. Filing the application with Trade Marks Registry
 </strong>
 <br/>
 A trademark can be applied for either physically at any of the Trademark Offices having appropriate jurisdiction. There are a total of five Trademark Offices in India located at New Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Chennai. Each office shall have jurisdiction over the particular zone they are located in. For example the Chennai Trademark Office shall be the appropriate Trademark Office for filing all applications from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.
</p> <p>
 A trademark may also be applied for online through the Indian Trademark Registry, however, a digital signature is required for filing an online application. It is always recommended that you seek appropriate legal assistance while filing a trademark application.
</p> <p>
 Once the trademark has been applied for it usually takes anywhere between 18 to 24 months (based on our experience in registering brands) for the Trademark Office to register the mark and issue the Registration Certificate, provided, no objections or opposition is received.
